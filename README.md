# ScientificCalculator
This GUI project is still in development. 
It'll be updated every two days or so. 
I copied the UI of the Windows Calculator so they may look similar to each other :). 
So far, these are the functions available: 
1. Basic arithematic operations (+, -, *, and /)
2. The Â± function
3.
