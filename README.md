So far, these are the functions available: 
1. Basic arithematic operations (+, -, *, and /). These operations comply to the BODMAS rule
2. Signing and unsigning numbers with the Â± button
3. The "C" button can be used to clear the display or the "del" button can be used to delete one digit at a time from right to left

The equals and parentheses buttons have little bugs that will be fixed in the next update

A JAR file is also available for download
