# ScientificCalculator
This GUI project is still in development. 
It'll be updated every two days or so. 
I copied the UI of the Windows Calculator so they look quite similar to each other :)

So far, these are the functions available: 
1. Basic arithematic operations (+, -, *, and /). These operations comply to the BODMAS rule
2. Signing and unsigning numbers with the Â± button
3. Creating decimal numbers with the "." button
4. The "C" button can be used to clear the display or the "del" button can be used to delete one digit at a time from right to left

The equals and parentheses buttons have little bugs that will be fixed in the next update

A JAR file is also available for download
